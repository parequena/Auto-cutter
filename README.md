# Auto-cutter
This is a script I use to automate the use of `auto-editor`, as I was a bit tired of using it with videos, there is still work to be done, feel free to make a PR to contribute to the repository.

# Dependencies
Currently, we are working with some dependencies, those are:
- Bash to execute the script (in theory it should be compatible with Windows 11 Terminal, but not tested)
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [auto-editor](https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor)

# Tested on
- [x] Arch Linux WSL `Linux xxxxx 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2`
- [ ] Windows 10/11 Terminal

# TODO
- [ ] Automatize yt-dlp download to the folder and use it as input.
- [ ] Allow a single video input.
- [ ] Add a script parameter to parametrice `auto-editor` (currently parameters are hardcoded).
- [ ] Add a script parameter to parametrice `yt-dlp` (TODO)
